Python Tkinter Checkbox Example
This is a simple Python script that creates a GUI window with checkboxes using the Tkinter library.
The window displays a label asking the user to select a programming language of their choice, and four checkboxes with the options "Java," "C++," "C," and "Python."
# Usage
To use this script, simply run it in your Python environment. A window will appear with the label and checkboxes.
Select the checkboxes for the programming languages you're interested in, and click the "OK" button to submit your selections.
